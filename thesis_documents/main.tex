    % One of the challenges in the field of intelligent systems is to understand how individuals subjectively perceive situations during interactions. Concepts like the appraisal process and situation perception serve as frameworks for systematically assessing situations and conversation partners in cognitive science. Situational interdependence, a facet of situation perception, measures how an individual perceives a situation influencing both their and others' outcomes. This research aims to fill gaps in understanding how the appraisal process shapes an individual's summary evaluation of situational interdependence by modelling a representation of the appraisal process from textual content and non-textual verbal cues and how the context settings of conversation play roles here. Success in this research contributes to broadening the scope of researching the appraisal process from a computational point of view and potentially leads to a more sophisticated way of automatically recognizing a user's perceived situational interdependence across various contexts.
